# Vision 3.0 : Intruder Detection System For Your PC

This software is an "Automated Security Surveillance System" for your laptop or desktop computer.
When activated, this system detects and reports whenever an unauthorized person attempts to touch your device.

## System Capabilities
Using OpenCV, the system accesses your webcam and opens the live video feed to monitor the surroundings and using advanced Proximity-Detection it calculates the distance between a detected human body and the lense of your webcam and if the calculated distance is less or equal to the defined DISTANCE_DANGER_THRESHOLD, it triggers a loud alarm to stun the intruder and alerts other people that an intruder is trying to touch your computer.
